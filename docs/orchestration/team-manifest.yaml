notes: |
  This manifest defines the complete organizational structure for
  BACOWR development. It serves as the single source of truth for:

  - Team responsibilities and boundaries
  - Coordination and sequencing rules
  - Module naming conventions
  - Quality gates and success criteria

  Teams should reference this manifest when planning work to ensure
  proper coordination and avoid conflicts.
